**Queue** is an idea of an app to _remotely_ get into a restaurant queue, so you can arrive at the restaurant once your table is ready.

:trophy: Winner of [Movile](https://movile.com/)'s 24-Hour Hackathon QuickBuck.

The idea's "pitch presentation" can be seen [here](https://prezi.com/s5d6t-eyn6r_/queue/) :smiley:.
